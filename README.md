# Python_Card_Game
This is the first project I started creating 3 weeks into my
python programming lectures. It's a card game I enjoyed playing with my
siblings growing up.
The Rules of the 'Liar Card Game':
      A card is randomly chosen as the reference card and the card is displayed.
      Each player gets a set of cards and take turn playing a card from
      their set. The suit of the card played must match the reference card's.
      The player who is caught lying collects all the cards that have
      been played so far. The winner is the first player to have no card left.
     
 The code is still being refined.
